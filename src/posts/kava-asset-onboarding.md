<h2 class="Section-title">Introduction</h2>

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is hard for most users to understand. It’s an interesting blend of stock trading, technical hurdles, anonymity and peer to peer economics, wrapped in the form of a n online bank. For many users, it takes hours of personal time with a friend to help them get started. The value prop in it all though, is simply “Earn More With Your Crypto”.
 
Most DeFi apps focused on one aspect of finance like peer to peer Lending and Borrowing. So one user could Lend Bitcoin and another user could pay interest to the Lender to borrow Bitcoin. Rather than just hold Bitcoin, users can lend it to earn an extra 2-5%. This is peer to peer lending and borrowing system is called a Money Market. 

Kava Labs focused on multiple aspects of DeFi; Money Markets, Stablecoin Minting, Decentralized Trading, Staking and Farming. The goal of this project is to take all these aspects DeFi and streamline it into a simple to use product.

<h2 class="Section-title">The Challenge</h2>

Onboarding rates for users visiting the app and actually supplying was around xxxxxx, despite some yield opportunities ranging as high as 200%. When trying to bring in brand new users from marketing channels, that number was even less. Typically it took users coming to the app multiple times before actually supplying.

Not only was there there a lot to take in, but also a lot of steps to take to get to the point of supplying. Unless you have understand the nuances of Defi it can be difficult for figure out what those steps were.

/Note, this doesn’t include adding assets to your wallet and assumes the user has the required assets in their wallet already./

Technical hurdles within this workflow compounded the complexity too. For example, depositing the asset ATOM initially required the use of the Keplr wallet although it was visible within Trust wallet. BNB deposits however were only supported with Trust wallet. So each stage in the funnel offered it’s own unique challenges depending on asset and wallet used.

There was a lot of user value in Kava’s suite of products, but with that many options and hurdles it was hard to see that value, even harder to take advantage of it. It took a good amount of industry experience to get onboarded and even more experience to really use the platform to its fullest.

<h2 class="Section-title">The Approach</h2>

#### Strategy

Flip the user experience around to be more asset and use case driven instead of product and feature driven. So rather then onboarding users to a lending feature within a money market product for example, we onboard Bitcoin (BTC) holders to earn an extra 20%+ with the asset they already hold.

[ asset flow vs protocol flow]

This approach allowed us to streamline the user workflow from top of funnel to bottom and give users a simple and consistent CTA throughout. Earn X% with Y% token. The rest of the experience can revolve around that simple value prop. 

It also created space for us to guide users around any hurdles and educate them as to how this value is being created.

<h2 class="Section-title">The Details</h2>

### Iteration 1: The surge pages
We were in the process of launching new and noticed an enticing use case where these new markets would see APYs in the hundreds and thousands for a limited time. All users had to do was supply X asset to Lend. 

[ surge page UI & Touchpoints ]

Once users landed on the page, we reiterated the promotional value of the surge, created clear steps for users to take and have them the ability to take those steps without leaving the page. For example in this case, a user would have to go to the balances page first to deposit, the. Go to lend to supply. This handled that in a single space and gave guidance on which wallet was required.

[ details on specifics of the surge page ]

Overall this approach worked great! Each time we launched a new surge event, we created large traffic spikes and grew the user base x%. Conversion rate for surge page users compared to standard was xxx% better (x vs x).

Traffic however wasn’t that impressive and these pages had a shelf life. In this use case too, our users didn’t have much trouble supplying to money markets. Still, brand new users favored the asset landing approach.

[ traffic if page compared to lend ]

Shelf life wasn’t great either. Since the use case itself was fleeting, the usefulness of the feature was too.

### Iteration 2: kava earn strategies
Seeing some success in this asset and use case focused approach, we deceived to apply this logic to more complex DeFi strategies that provided more sustainable value to users. 

For example users could supply BUSD to Kava Mint and borrow USDX, then supply that USDX to Kava Lend in order earn through the USDX money market on Kava Lend. This strategy provided BUSD holders with a x% higher yield then just supplying BUSD to Kava Lend directly.

[ manual mint to lend workflow ] 

We didn’t have a great way to measure conversion of this workflow as a whole, but we did know that borrowing in general was only done by more advanced users. So Kava Mint as a whole was more of an expert mode feature. To make this effective strategy more accessible to all users, we condensed the various transactions down to a simple supply and withdraw experience within its own focused landing page.

[ BUSD Earn & Kava Earn ]

We also moved the step logic into the supply modal for guidance.

Again, conversion rates for this page was good and it saw good usage. It immediately competed with kava mint as the primary source of BUSD supplied

[ conversion rates and usage comparison ]

As we started adding more strategies and building these out into its own feature though. The usage started taking off for both BUSD and others..

One under rated aspect of DeFi is building trust. While Kava Earn pages didn’t immediate explode in the same way the surge pages did, the more users become comfortable with them as a feature, they started taking off and surpassing the other protocols in terms of usage.
