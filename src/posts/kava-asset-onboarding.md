<h2 class="Section-title">Introduction</h2>

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is hard for most users to understand. It’s an interesting blend of stock trading, technical hurdles, anonymity and peer to peer economics, wrapped in the form of an online bank. For many users, it takes hours of personal time with a friend to help them get started. The value prop in it all though, is simply “Earn More With Your Crypto”.
 
Most DeFi apps focused on one aspect of finance like peer to peer Lending and Borrowing. So one user could Lend Bitcoin and another user could pay interest to the Lender to borrow Bitcoin. Rather than just hold Bitcoin, users can lend it to earn an extra 2-5%. This is peer to peer lending and borrowing system is called a Money Market. 

Kava Labs focused on multiple aspects of DeFi; Money Markets, Stablecoin Minting, Decentralized Trading, Staking and Farming. The goal of this project is to take all these aspects DeFi and streamline it into a simple to use product. This article outlines how we iterated over 3 projects to acheive that goal.

<h2 class="Section-title">The Challenge</h2>

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--largeText">
There was value on the Kava platform, but it was a spread across multiple apps, barried in tables and described by market parameters. While valuable information, it was hard to see that value, even harder to take advantage of it. It took a good amount of industry experience to get onboarded and even more experience to really use the platform to its fullest.
</blockquote>

Each product on the Kava platform had at least one interesting selling point. Kava Mint for example had 0% interest rate on stablecoin loans. Kava Lend offered 20%+ easy yield opportunites on multiple coins, while Kava Swap was in the 200% return range.

#### A combersome process

The full funnel for supplying assets to a DeFi app is pretty combersome. It involves multiple steps controlled by multiple companies and products that may or may not easily connect with they other. Being a decentralized finance platform, we didn’t require KYC, so couldn’t sell coins directly with cash or credit cards. Our part of the funnel focused on the assets that had already been withdrawn from central exchanges (CEXs) to a self custody wallet.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/Overall-DeFi-Flow.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Finding Value in the App

After pulling assets off a central exchange and finding Kava, there was a lot to take in, a lot of data in tables. Unless you understand the nuances of Defi it can be difficult for figure out what to do and where to go. We often got feedback that users wanted some guidance when landing on the app. Most users were drawn to simply supplying to Kava Lend.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/Kava-side-by-side.jpg" />
  <figcaption class="u-padBottomMd">Side by Side Kava Feature app and Staking in Trust Wallet (right)</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Deposting & Supplying

Even with the simplest use case of supplying to Kava Lend, users had to bounce between multiple pages and modals to then connect their wallet, deposit to the Kava blockchain and and supply to Lend.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/Supply-BTC-Lend.jpg" />
  <figcaption class="u-padBottomMd">Workflow for Supplying BTC to Lend</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Dealing with Technical Hurdles

Lastly, different wallets and assets came with certain technical hurdles to compounded the complexity in workflows. For example, depositing the asset ATOM initially required the use of the Keplr wallet although it was visible within Trust wallet. BNB assets also had some quirks between Trust Wallet and Keplr.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/ATOM-lend-workflow.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Onboarding Rates Where Rough

For users visiting the app and actually supplying was around xxxxxx, despite some yield opportunities ranging as high as 200%. When trying to bring in brand new users from marketing channels, that number was even less. Typically it took users coming to the app multiple times before actually supplying.

<h2 class="Section-title">The Approach</h2>

#### Strategy

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--largeText">
Flip the user experience around to be more asset driven rather than product driven and streamline the user workflow from top of funnel to bottom by giving users a simple and consistent CTA throughout. Earn X% interest with Y asset.
</blockquote>

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/Strategy-workflow.jpg" />
</figure>

So rather then onboarding users to a Lending product, we onboard Bitcoin (BTC) holders to earn an extra 20%+ with the asset they already hold and created dedicated spaces to give them any extra guidance that was needed for specific use cases.

#### Key Metrics

##### Total visitors
How many people visit the app and feature. Serves as a measure of how interesting the value prop is, how much interest we can generate with holders of specific assets. 

##### Total users
The total number of users that supplied assets to the Kava platform. One of the top level metrics to determine health of the app. This metric would also be dimentioned by asset, feature and page to determine which parts of the app were the most valuable.

 ##### Conversion rate (users/visitors)
Of those visiters, what percentage of them actually supplied. This is the primarmy metric to look at for determining how much our updates were streamlining the experience.

##### Total value locked 
The total value of the assets supplied. Our topline company metric and the overall goal of the product team; increase TVL. This metric was dimensioned in the same way as users to better determine which parts of the product where most valuable.

##### Average User (Total Value Locked/Total Users)
Gave use insight as to the size of our users based on wallet size. While not a primary metric for use to determine value of features, it did give us good insight into what levers to pull for engaing different user types.

<div class="Article-feature">

### Iteration 1: The surge pages

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--largeText">
While adding new assets to Lend we noticed an interesting use case where users would earn 200%+ for limited time, simply by supplying while liquidity was low. It seemed like a great value prop to test while launching assets, and a great opportunity to test the asset focused approach.
</blockquote>

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/Atom-Surge-Flow-Funnel.jpg" />
</figure>

Marketing put together some graeat branding for the concept and launched twitter campeigns specifically targeting ATOM holders. Once users landed on the page, we reiterated the promotional value of the "Surge", created clear steps for users to take supply ATOM to Kava Lend.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/AtomSurge-Page-Overview.jpg" />
</figure>

Rather then sending users out to the balances page and Kava Lend to complete the steps, we gave users the ability to take those steps without leaving the page by loading in the modals directly to this ATOM Surge Landing. It was a single place where user's could learn about the Surge, Connect, Deposit, Supply and earn 200%+ on their ATOM. 

#### Primary Takeaways

Overall this approach worked great! Each time we launched a new surge event, we created large traffic spikes and grew the user base x%. Conversion rate for surge page users compared to standard was xxx% better (x vs x).

[ metrics graphics around traffic spikes and conversion rates ]

Traffic however wasn’t that impressive and these pages had a shelf life. In this use case too, our users didn’t have much trouble supplying to money markets. Still, brand new users favored the asset landing approach.

[ traffic if page compared to lend ]

Shelf life wasn’t great either. Since the use case itself was fleeting, the usefulness of the feature was too.

[ surge page traffic ]

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--centered Blockquote--largeText">
The asset focused landing page did a great job of converting users, but the value was fleeting and was most effective with brand new users who deposited small amounts. Ultimatly, we needed to find a way of providing sustained user value that catered to a wider user base.
</blockquote>

<div class="Article-feature">

### Iteration 2: The BUSD Earn Strategy

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--largeText">
Seeing success with conversion rates on the surge pages, we felt that was enough to expand on the idea and apply that asset and use case focused logic to more complex DeFi strategies that provided more sustainable value to users. 
</blockquote>

In this case, users supplying BUSD to Kava Lend would earn 5% (which was inline with other Lending products), but if a user used their BUSD to borrow USDX on Kava Mint at 0% interest and a 99% loan to value ratio, then supplied that USDX to Kava Lend, they would earn 20% through the USDX money market on Kava Lend. Being Kava's native stable coin, it was overly incentivzed to facilitate more Kava Mint usage. This strategy provided BUSD holders with a 4x higher yield than just supplying BUSD direclty to a lending product.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/BUSD-Earn-Strategy.jpg" />
</figure>

Collaberating with the dev team, we realized transaction messages for this strategy could be condensed down to a single user action. So rather than having a user do upwards of 4 different transactions, we could actually condense it down to 1 or 2, depending on how far down they funnel users alread were. We could turn this strategy into a very simple supply & withdraw experince. 

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/BUSD-Earn-Breakdown.jpg" />
</figure>

To continue helping users move along the funnel stages, we also built that into the supply modal using conditional logic depending on the state of the user's wallet. For example, IF they weren't connected we prompted them to connect, then chained together other modals required to supply; connect, deposit, supply. This pattern could also be applied to other actions on the platform, like supplying to Lend.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/BUSD-Earn-Modal-Workflow.jpg" />
</figure>

The Primary value prop was, simple <b>Earn 4x more with your BUSD</b>. Secondary though, this space could also be used to level up our users. In surveying our user base and following up with user interviews something we learned was this borrowing was the primary barrier for new users in expanding their DeFi usage. Users that had less than 2 years of experience with DeFi apps often felt intimidated by concept of leveraging their assets. So for newer users the value prop was educational on top of being more lucrative. 

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/BUSD-Earn-Learn-More.jpg" />
</figure>

#### Primary Takeaways

Usage was promising. Right from the start BUSD Earn was a competitor for the number one source of BUSD being supplied to the app.

[ graph of BUSD Earn TVL usage ]

Conversion rates for this BUSD Earn page didn't get to the levels of the surge pages, but still outperformed the baseline at a good rate. Traffic to page also remained more consistent.

[ Conversion rates & traffic ]

Secondary to the BUSD Earn page, the learn more article that went into detail on how te strategy worked was also seeing continued interest. I think this is a good indicator that the educational aspect of these strategies is also valuable to users.

[stats of the BUSD article ]

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--centered Blockquote--largeText">
The asset & use case focused landing still performed well with cconversion rate and the usage of both page & article was a clear indicator of interest. We didn't seem to be earning the trust of experienced users though.  
</blockquote>

<div class="Article-feature">

### Iteration 3: The Kava Earn Feature

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--largeText">
There was enough success with BUSD Earn to expand on the idea and setup Earn pages for new assets. During the next major release we launched 3 more strategies and built them into a more dedicated feature. KAVA, USDC and USDT were the new asset pages.
</blockquote>

Things were working well with BUSD Earn, so during the next major release we launched 3 more strategies and built them into a more dedicated feature. KAVA, USDC and USDT. KAVA was a staking strategy while USDT and USDC both supplied to a new protocol called KAVA Boost. While the USDT, USDC and KAVA pages didn't take off initially, BUSD saw a big jump in usage.

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/kava-onboarding/Kava-Earn-Feature.jpg" />
</figure>

One under rated aspect of DeFi is building trust. While Kava Earn pages didn’t immediate explode in the same way the surge pages did, as more users become comfortable with them as a feature, they started taking off and surpassing the other protocols in terms of usage. The Kava Earn pages we're stratight forward and easy to use, now they we're becoming trusted. 

[ spike after the new pages and comparisoon to other features]

<blockquote class="Blockquote Blockquote--centered Blockquote--largeText">
As soon as we started adding more strategies and building this concept into a larger feature, adoption immediatly started taking off. vAll in all, we tracked over 130 Million supplied to the BUSD Earn  page and over 40 million supplied to the KAVA Earn page.
</blockquote>
