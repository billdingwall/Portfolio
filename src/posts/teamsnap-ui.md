title: "TeamSnap Design System"
blurb: A 10% time project that spanned the length of my career at TeamSnap. When I started, the web app was a bit out dated to say the least and in dire need of a refresh. We needed a more component-driven approach. This is a breakdown of how to tackle a project of this scale from a design standpoint and how to do it without major company investment.
