title: "Design Archive"
blurb: Just a collection of work I've done over the years. Some from working with clients like Hero Design Studio and Lucent PDX, some from classes or internships and friends. All are projects I've enjoyed working on and felt like they helped me to grow to the designer + developer I am today.
