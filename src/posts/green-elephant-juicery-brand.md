### The Situation

Entrepreneurs from Vail, Colorado are launching a new organic juice and vegetarian café restaurant brand, Green Elephant Juicery. Green Elephant will be based in Edwards, Colorado. Edwards is likely the location for the first café and juice production.

The idea for Green Elephant was inspired by several existing café and juice bands that Leo and John have admired, such as Life Alive, Juice Press and One Lucky Duck.

While developing a space for the first café, Green Elephant will begin juice production and bottling in a commercial kitchen. During this time the brand will be introduced to the Vail Valley and bottled juices will be sold through kiosks, local outlets, and farmers markets.

Green Elephant mission: To serve our local community delicious, fresh, fast, top quality, organic, vegetarian food and juices in an affordable and timely manner, making it easy to eat well. Delicious.

### Market Segment

Local business primarily targeting middle to upper class health conscious men and women ages 25 - 40. On top of their primary location in Edwards they plan on growing their business through farmers markets, delivery services and pop up stands at the base of Vail and Beaver Creek Mountain Resorts.

### Overall Project Goals

The goal of this project is to lay the foundations for the Green Elephant brand through the design of the logo, typography and color palette.

The brand attributes include the words: delicious, alive, local, honest, sustainable, fun, active, healthy, electric, authentic, humble, conscious, community-focused. Organic. Veggie. Easy. Organic Cold-Pressed Juices Alive, Not Pasteurized

## Research & Ideation

### Research

Like any design project, started with researching general visual styles related to organic and local products.

### Sketching

Knowing the name of the business already imagery was pretty straight forward to start sketching on. The personality of the elephant however is a little trickier. I started sketching a pretty wide range of elephants to compare and get a good idea of what kind of elephant we wanted to move forward with. Some more rounded, others block, some playful and active, others more static,tusks, no tusks, etc. Ultimately we decided to move towards a younger elephant because it because it fit in with the playful and active nature of the brand. The primary goal in this exercise was to find a distinct shape, something that could be used as a sticker or stencil and could standalone as a recognizable brand element.

### Color Study

When meeting with the clients and Getting to know the product better, one thing that stood out immediately was how vibrant the juice colors were. Seemed like great inspiration when considering the color palette.

### Typography Study

Moving to typography started looking at a few different options that all had some nice organic qualities to them. Looking at thicker fonts for that sense of strength you get with an elephant, script fonts for the active nature of them, serifs for some of the organic qualities and condensed fonts that tie into the thought of cold pressed juice. Really focused on the type structures and how they support the brand words or don’t.

### Logo Iterations

Taking those ideas from the studies started working through some rough variations trying to think back on those key brand words. More and more it became apparent the trunk of the elephant was a big source of personality. The tusks too, seemed a bit adolescent when compared to the baby. The elephant itself added to that.
