<h2 class="Section-title">Introduction</h2>

Matic insurance services was essentially a full service insurance aggregator, so users could submit details about their home and financial history to receive dozens of quotes from various insurance companies. There was an online presence for people to find us, but the primary line of business our “Servicing” line of business. Matic would pair with mortgage providers and sent emails to lists of people who’s insurance was reaching it’s renewal period.

The experience consisted of three functions; an insurance agency to sell policies, a product to automatically aggregate quotes from different insurance companies and a marketing touch-points guide users to those quotes. The growth team worked collaboratively with all three functions to refine the Servicing Funnel.

Through these mortgages partnerships we had email lists of 10,000 - 30,000 home owners that were coming up on their policy renewal date and all the required info to run quotes. Our growth team was well established and had spent years refining our servicing funnel through an A/B testing process. The goal was to improve conversion rates for our servicing funnel through that A/B testing process.

* Ran user tests to evaluate the current UI
* Conducted user research to define design & content strategies

<h2 class="Section-title">The Challenge</h2>

The current servicing funnel was successful. The growth team had been working on it for a couple years, polishing the UI, massaging the copy and iterating on the offering, resulting in a conversion rates of 40% for lead generation, 22% APIC(contact) and 3% monotization. Commisions for policies sold varied around $100, so for every 10,000 visits roughly $30,000 revenue was generated.

#### Funnel Breakdown

1. **Email Marketing:** Send them an email introducing our selves and directing them a landing page.

2. **Landing & Quote Display:** Depending on the user's prescore results, they were either taken to a landing highlighting savings found or a landing to run and display home insurance quotes. Consent to call (TCPA) is collected on the landing and a lead us generated.

3. **Contact with an agent:** An agent calls the lead generated on the landing if they have not scheduled a call in advance. If the agent is able to get a customer on the phone it contributes to APIC(contact) rate.

4. **Agent sells a policy:** If an agent sells a policy Matic gets a commission. Monotization rate is a refacltion of customers that make it to this step in the process.

The agency was growing and could easily handle any lead that came it’s way. So for growth team the goal was simple; get customers on the phone with agents.

<h2 class="Section-title">The Approach</h2>

#### A/B Testing Process

Both tracks lead to a handful positive A/B tests and spanned about about 2-3 weeks to collect statistically significant data. At times tests we’re stacked in different parts of the funnel, but how those tests potentially interacted was definitely under consideration.

#### Research

To set a direction for the what tests to run was lacking. So, with the goal of “get customers on the phone with agents” being top of mind, I kicked this off round of research to uncover how and why potential customers would want to talk with an agent.

#### Strategies

##### Position our agents as expert advisors
I found that people do find value in talking to agents, especually if they have any questions about a policy. They just don't want to be "sold" a policy. So the idea here is to let them know our agents are here to answer whatever questions they might have, make sure they understand the details and feel confident in they’re policy and potentailly get them better deals. All of which was true for our agents.

##### Personalize the experience
In listening to participants answer questions about getting in contact with agents, several mentioned wanting that experience to be more personal. So the idea here is to show them we know who they are, they’re situation and that we’re providing value unique to them. Make it as relevant as possible to that specific person. This also ties in well with the "position our agents as experts" strategy.

<div class="Article-feature">

### Savings Landing
#### Before

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/matic-testing/SF-before.jpg" />
</figure>

**Conversation Rate:** 22%

**Background:** It wasn’t pretty, but for over a year this version of the savings landing beat tests versions in conversion and APIC rate. 

**Analysis:** When user testing, Some common feedback was it’s OK, makes sense, etc. It seemed all the elements were there but it wasn’t anything exciting. In Fullstory, noticed the elements the FAQ saw as many clicks as the primary CTA.

<hr class="Divider u-spaceBottomLg" />

#### Experiment 1: Savings Revamp

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/matic-testing/Savings-revamp.jpg" />
</figure>

**Background:** Given the FAQ interaction this seemed like a great fit for testing the agent focus strategy, or in this case just agency in general. 

**Hypothesis:** By keeping the elements of the original version above the fold and introducing elements that better played up the agency & process below the fold, we could better capitalize on initial interest and retain interest of users not immediately sold.

**Result:** lead gen% shot up to as high as 40% on desktop (nearly doubling control) with no drop off in APIC%. Mobile however dipped by 2%. Scroll rates were surprisingly low, as nearly 90% of users never made past the carrier Intro section just below the hero.

**Learning:** It seemed like the added content below the fold had a minimal effect, but the hero space was much more effectively used.

<hr class="Divider u-spaceBottomLg" />

#### Experiment 2: Savings Mobile Update

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/matic-testing/Savings-revamp-mobile.jpg" />
</figure>

**Background:** looking back at the original version on mobile, it was less cluttered and did a better job drawing attention to the quote. I wanted to keep the CTA above the fold however.

**Hypothesis:** by reducing the elements above the fold, bringing that recommended quote highlight and keeping the CTA above the fold we should be able to bring that lead gen rate back above to the original at least.

**Result:** It worked as planned. Lead gen rate went up by 5% on mobile with no effect on APIC.

**Learning:** in general, but potentially more so with mobile, I think UI enhancements can net good results. It can be easy to get caught up with exciting new ideas when trying to grow, but UX & UI improvements can be just as powerful at times.

### All Funnel Quotes
#### Before

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/matic-testing/Quotes-before.jpg" />
</figure>

**Conversation Rate:** 6%

Background: We knew that if a customer selected a quote, they were much more likely to purchase a policy. Quote selection rate was 3% if we didn’t find savings and nearly 30% if we did. Other then our quoting service finding them savings and a few carriers we searched, there wasn’t much else for users to consider in the quoting process.

<hr class="Divider u-spaceBottomLg" />

#### Experiment 1: Agent Services

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/matic-testing/Quotes-agent-services.jpg" />
</figure>

**Background:** given the research findings that customers would want to talk to insurance advisors (agents) as long as the goal was to help them sift through the noise, this seemed like a great space to play up our agents in that manor. Promoting agent services as a secondary option also gave users something else to click on if the quotes didn’t hit the mark.

**Hypothesis:** If we add a new section after the quotes that plays up other services our agents can provide, click rates this page should improve as well as overall APIC rates.

**Result:** While only 1% of customers actually clicked the new offerings, APIC saw an xxx% increase.

Learning:

#### Experiment 2: Bundle Prompt

<figure class="Article-image">
  <img src="/../../img/matic-testing/Quotes-agent-services-savings.jpg" />
</figure>

**Background:** With the first agent services test being successful the idea here was to continue that strategy on the savings found version of quotes page.

**Hypothesis:** If we added similar elements to other parts of the quotes page variations we could see similar success.

**Result:** APIC rate for the savings segment of went up by xxx

**Learning:** Seems like the  Agent Promo strategy seems to be working well, at least within this part of the user experience.

**Background:** This was a larger project after a several tests at various points of the user journey. I was working with our team of Florida insurance experts to understand the unique challenges of selling insurance in Florida.

**Hypothesis:** By both playing up our agents and customizing their value props to users in Florida, we can make a personal connection with them an better entice them to speak with an agent.

**Result:** lead gen rate and APIC both say nice boosts. 
Learning: there seems to be a lot of merit to the personalized agent based on location idea. Some other great places to expand this idea would

</figure>

#### Key Wins:
* 20% Increase in Lead Gen Rate
* 10% Incfease in APIC Rate

#### Primary Takeways:
* 
* The Position our agents as expert advisors strategy seemed to work really well while users we're evaluating different quotes, but I think there could be more testing higher up in the funnel. For example, the into email could better job introducing the agent over the agency
* The Personalized experience strategy
* There were a few tests that focused more on workflow and UI upgrades rather then content updates and
