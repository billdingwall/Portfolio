<h2 class="Section-title">Product Background</h2>

Kava is a suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps that allows users to take out loans against their crypto assets, lend different crypto assets for others to borrow, supply a pair of two different crypto currencies as liquidity to help facilitate trades and trade between various cryptocurrencies. All this functionality was broken up between 3 different products, Kava Mint, Kava Lend and Kava Swap. 

Through these products and features, users are able to leverage their crypto assets to earn more than they otherwise would just holding them in their wallet or account.  For example Lending Bitcoin earns users about 2% APY because users borrowing Bitcoin pay the lenders interest. Rewards are also paid to lenders in the form of KAVA to help build up the initial pool assets to then borrow from.

Most DeFi apps tend to focus on 1 aspect of DeFi like Lending and Borrowing, but since Kava had 3 unique products that cover multiple aspects of DeF, it actually created an interesting value prop for our users to explore different earning strategies, like a DeFi playground.

### User Problem

The challenge with so many options in one app though was it also added complexity, making it difficult to see the real value of the platform as a whole. 
It took a good amount of industry experience to get onboarded and even more experience to really use the platform to its fullest. Onboarding rates for users visiting the app and actually supplying was around xxxxxx. When trying to bring in new users from marketing channels, that number was even less.

Not only we’re there a lot of steps to take to get to the point of supplying, but unless you have understand the nuances of Daefi it can be difficult for o figure out how Jay the steps were.

[ user flow for depositing assets ]

From a product standpoint, we were getting ready add new assets across the app and support a new wallet. For those not familiar with DeFi, this isn’t as straight forward as it would seem as y there are no current standards. One asset is compatible with 1 wallet, the other not so much etc

## Project Details

### Strategy
Longer term we wanted to try flipping the user experience around to by more asset driven instead of protol driven so this we wanted to set the up as the initial page in a line of testing.

[ user flow of asset first vs feature first  ]

For this project we decided to focus on the asset itself first and it’s primary use case. Then funnel our marketing efforts around one asset and one use case at a time.

### asset landing test, surge page tests (v1)
* use case. Short time APY boosts
* steps to outline requirements
* Space to give context
* Played up with surge brand and promo
* Result 
* Takeaways

### kava earn pages (v2)
* applying that logic to strategies 
* Moving flow to modals to expand 
* Not immediate success took time to build trust
* as we added more it grew fast
* Adding in more steps the modal flows didn’t work as well. Wspey with eth assets
* Overall it was a success
* Result
* Takeaways
