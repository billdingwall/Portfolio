<h2 class="Section-title">Introduction</h2>

At Matic we had a solid funnel for servicing home owners with insurance policies and a team dedicated refining that funnel. The experience consisted of three functions; an insurance agency to sell policies, a product to automatically aggregate quotes from different insurance companies and a marketing touchpoints guide users to those quotes. The growth team worked collaboratively with all three functions to refine the funnel.

Through partnerships with various mortgaging companies, we had email lists of 10,000 - 30,000 home owners that were coming up on their policy renewal date and all the required info to run quotes. Our growth team was well established and had spent years refining our servicing funnel through an A/B testing process. The goal was to improve conversion rates for our servicing funnel through that A/B testing process.

<h2 class="Section-title">The Challenge</h2>

Overall conversion rate for the servicing funnel was 1%. From that initial 10-30k list of potential users we’d:

1. Pre Score
	* Run a pre-score process to determine if we can save them money.

2. Email Marketing
	* Send them an email introducing our selves and directing them a landing page.

3. Landing & Quote Display
	1. A. If we can save them money, we send them to the savings landing where we show a quote upfront. 
	2. B. If we don’t know if we can save them money. We send them to another landing that prompts them to run their quotes.

4. Contact with an agent
	1. 

5. Agent sells a policy and Matic gets a $100  -$200 dollar commission from the insurance company.

At this point in time the agency side was growing and could easily handle any lead that came it’s way, so the initial challenge was to het more leads to our agents.

The primary KPIs to target for this we’re
* email conversion 
* Landing conversation
* APIC rate

<h2 class="Section-title">The Approach</h2>

The approach for this work was to run A/B tests that dive into the specifics of how users interacted with the UI as well as our agents and iteratively test UI updates, the content framing our offer and general workflow updates across all parts of the servicing funnel. While testing, the learnings from previous tests would help inform future tests and determine value of larger strategies.

I had done some survey studies specifically around and contact preferences, competitive research and review of our funnel to come up with three primary strategies to test within.

* Build trust in our agent
* Workflow refinements
* UI refinements

Tests took about 2-3 weeks to collect the required data so we had to spread these tests around different parts of the funnel and run them concurrently.
