Product design lead for multiple core business units. Worked across multiple teams to build new products and expand existing products, allowing TeamSnap to grow itâ€™s platform and explore opportunities in new market segments.

Led development in the redesign of our web apps and marketing site. Worked with other designers, developers and QA to help us adopt a component-driven design approach.

Created onboarding experiences for both customers and employees. Mentored incoming and junior designers to help them grow and be successful. I grew a lot in the process too.
