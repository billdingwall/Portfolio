I had the pleasure of working on a team with Bill and implementing his designs at Teamsnap. Our product was very data heavy. Bill's knack for making complicated forms and data tables look friendly and accessible made the interface feel effortless, and his solid grasp of front end technologies and their capabilities and weaknesses made his designs a slam dunk to implement. He is exactly the kind of designer any developer would love to work with. He's humble, easy going, self-motivated, and a talented designer as well. I would enthusiastically recommend him for whatever he put his mind to.
