Bill is an extremely skilled UX/UI designer. He's extremely user focused and designs based off analytics and user feedback. His designs are smooth and flow together nicely, and he does a fantastic job designing in components. Bill has been an instrumental part of building out TeamSnap's component library and continues to show excellent levels of ownership with that project. Working with Bill has made my job easier and the entire company trusts him to take care of our flagship application, from a UX/Design perspective.
