Bill was a Senior Designer when I joined the team as a Junior Designer and while Bill was not my manager, he went out of his way to mentor me, provide feedback on my work and find projects to help me expand my skills. Thanks to Bill I was able to ramp up quickly and contribute to the team faster. He was constantly looking for ways to improve his own work as well, from going out on his own to research ways to improve the user experience to being incredibly receptive to feedback of his own designs.
