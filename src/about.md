intro: I’m fascinated by fractals, and how they shape both the natural and digital world. Infinitely complex patterns that are self similar across different scales, created by repeatable processes that occur in a constant feedback loop. I view that simple feedback loop as the foundation of all creative work. Simply weighing what something does, against what it’s trying to do and if it’s successful or not, then analyzing how a solution might be repeated across different areas of work. I think that simple process provides a great basis for objectively  discussing creative work and makes the design process more inclusive. Breaking solutions down to easily repeatable parts is also a great strategy for driving consistency both in branding and in product design. Before diving into digital design I was an artist and still like drawing, painting and photography here and there. At home though, I mostly just like relaxing with my wife and dogs or getting outside and doing something active.
